Python Module for Yahoo Finance Data Analysis

Introduction: This is my first time working with Github and my first attempt at a Python Module. All feedback is greatly welcomed. Thanks for stopping by!

Edit Notes: 
  - Break master into pieces with a separate file for each function? 
  - Ensure PEP 8 standards are upheld. 
  - Code review for each function: Start with one, get feedback and adjust others as necessary. Then further feedback on others.
